# VPC Routing Table Misconfiguration Resolution Guide

## Overview
This guide addresses EC2 instance communication failures across different Availability Zones due to VPC routing table misconfigurations.

## Symptoms
- Instances unable to communicate between subnets
- Failed ping tests between AZs
- Application timeout errors
- Database connection failures
- NAT Gateway connectivity issues

## Diagnosis Steps

### 1. Network Connectivity Testing
- Ping tests between instances
- Telnet to specific ports
- Traceroute analysis
- VPC Flow Log review
- Network packet analysis

### 2. Route Table Analysis
#### Check Routing Configuration
- Main route table settings
- Subnet associations
- Default routes
- Custom route entries

#### Verify Gateway Status
- Internet Gateway attachment
- NAT Gateway health
- VPC Endpoints configuration
- Transit Gateway routes

### 3. Security Verification
- Security Group rules
- Network ACL configurations
- VPC peering status
- VPN connection health

## Resolution Process

### 1. Route Table Verification
1. Access AWS Console > VPC > Route Tables
2. For each affected subnet:
   - Confirm correct route table association
   - Verify local route (VPC CIDR)
   - Check Internet Gateway route (public subnets)
   - Validate NAT Gateway route (private subnets)

### 2. Security Group Updates
1. Review inbound/outbound rules
2. Verify port configurations
3. Check CIDR block allowances
4. Update security group associations

### 3. Network ACL Configuration
1. Check inbound/outbound rules
2. Verify ephemeral ports
3. Update subnet associations
4. Test rule modifications

## Best Practices

### 1. Documentation
- Maintain network diagram
- Document route table configurations
- Keep security group matrices
- Update change logs

### 2. Monitoring
- Enable VPC Flow Logs
- Set up CloudWatch alerts
- Monitor network metrics
- Regular connectivity testing

### 3. Automation
- Use Infrastructure as Code
- Implement automated testing
- Regular configuration backups
- Automated compliance checks

## Preventive Measures
1. Regular Network Audits
   - Weekly configuration review
   - Monthly security assessment
   - Quarterly disaster recovery testing

2. Change Management
   - Documented approval process
   - Testing procedures
   - Rollback plans
   - Configuration versioning

3. Monitoring Setup
   - CloudWatch Alarms
   - VPC Flow Logs
   - Network health checks
   - Performance metrics

## Recovery Steps
1. Immediate Actions
   - Identify affected subnets
   - Check route propagation
   - Verify gateway health
   - Test basic connectivity

2. Resolution Implementation
   - Update route tables
   - Fix gateway attachments
   - Modify security rules
   - Test changes progressively

3. Validation Process
   - Test connectivity
   - Verify application access
   - Monitor error logs
   - Document results
